Host:    Foxbrain-9 (AVX512, FMA3, 7 GB RAM)
Command: bin\iqtree2 -s Combined_genes_BCO_prune.fasta -p Partition.txt.best_scheme.nex -B 1000 -alrt 1000
Seed:    743034 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jun 15 18:56:36 2023
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
